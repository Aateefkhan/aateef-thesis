A number of apps for Wikipedia's sister projects exist. These include the Wiki Loves Monuments app, written for a 2012 photo contest, as an aid for Wikiphotographers. It shows a map of nearby national heritage register items, indicating whether Wikipedia had a photo for the site, and enabling quick and easy photo uploads for camera phones. It is not integrated with the official article display app.[15]

There is an Android app for Wikimedia Commons[16] which is community maintained. There is also an Android app for Wiktionary, although it is no longer supported and has not been updated since August 2013.[17]

How to shift graphics/adjust placement of figure with \includegraphics
Ask Question

I composed a diagram that takes up the entire sheet of paper in landscape mode, called diagram.tex (compiled it to generate pdf). I'm trying to include that into an article, but only half of it is showing; the bottom half is cut off by the right end of the paper.

I was able to get it in the proper orientation by using

\includegraphics[angle=90]{diagram.pdf}

But because the bottom half of it is cut off, I need some sort of option where I can do something like this:

\includegraphics[angle=90, shift left = 5cm]{diagram.pdf}

to pull the rest of the image left (or up, depending on how you're looking at it).

So how can I move the figure around?
I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I'm using the following documentclass and packages in my paper:

\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,twoside]{article}
\usepackage{tikz, graphicx}
Edit:

This is not an issue with pushing it past the margins. Half of the picture is not on the paper (sort of like if you stuck half of your left hand behind the left side of your monitor). I need to pull the paper left (just like you would shift your hand left to see it).

have you tried to specify \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth, angle=90]{...}? – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 8:24 
@Holene I tried it an it shrinks the image, even though all of it is there – TheRealFakeNews Apr 7 '13 at 8:30
@KevinC Could you expand on that? I'm not even sure where in the manual I would be able to find that. – TheRealFakeNews Apr 7 '13 at 8:32

width = 1\textwidth will scale the input pdf such that it actually fits the page. I may misunderstand how your problem really looks like, but to me it sounds like you want to push the left side of the pdf past the page margins. In my opinion it's better to stay to the margins. Alternatively you could use the PDFpages package and include the entire PDF? – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 8:34 
@AlanH: Sorry I was wrong about my previous suggestion. But how about this: \hspace{-<some number>in}\includegraphics[angel=90]{...}? Basically this shifts the included picture left by <some number> inch. – Herr K. Apr 7 '13 at 9:03

 \includegraphics makes a box that is positioned the same way \mbox{} or A are positioned. If you want to move it 3cm to the left use

\hspace*{-3cm}\includegraphics.....

Sorry to interrupt; why use the starred version of \hspace? – Svend Tveskæg Apr 7 '13 at 9:35

@SvendTveskæg because if it is the beginning of a line white glue is discarded so white space and normal \hspace have no effect. – David Carlisle Apr 7 '13 at 9:39

To include shifts directly in the options part of the \includegraphics[options]{graphic.pdf} part of the command, a more straight forward way is the

`trim=left bottom right top` 
option. Here, left, bottom, right, and top are units of length, which trim the graphic for positive values and add space for negative values.

So to move to the right by 5cm and 1 cm from the top, you would do:

\includegraphics[trim=-5cm 0 0 -1cm]{diagram.pdf}

This worked for me. – polym May 13 '15 at 23:28
Does the trick, even though I find the parameter name to be misleading (I associate "trimming" with "cropping" instead of "offsetting"). – Waldir Leoncio May 11 '18 at 11:46
This works especially well with figures that have some trailing whitespace preventing any accurate automatic centering! If you trim the whitespace, automatic centering with \includegraphics[width=\linewidth] works again. – bhnn Oct 7 '18 at 17:31

Opting for an answer as the comments with a lot of code have pretty low readability. The ninja pic is taken from http://tinyurl.com/btapmmx

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{scope}
    \node {Node 1: \includegraphics[width=1 in]{images/ninja}};
    \end{scope}
    \begin{scope}[xshift=-5cm]
    \node {Node 2: \includegraphics[width=1 in]{images/ninja}};
    \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\end{document}
Node 2 is now shifted, so if you skip the code for the scopes and node 1, and include your pdf in node 2 you should be able to shift the included pdf here and there.

The result: enter image description here

Hmm, does the xshift option only work when there are two scopes? I was trying with only one scope, and the xshift option wasn't doing anything... – Herr K. Apr 7 '13 at 9:16

@KevinC No, you can simply do: \begin{tikzpicture}[xshift=-5cm] \node{node content}; \end{tikzpicture}. I added the two scopes just to illustrate the difference with and without xshift =) It works fine for me using only one scope too. – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 9:17 
@Holene Okay, I think it's because the picture I'm importing has a slight margin, so I need to pull it past the margin in my article, which is why nothing was shifting for me, it's already pulled to the margin of the article. If I rescale it, which I tried, the picture doesn't look right. – TheRealFakeNews Apr 7 '13 at 9:19
Have you tried adding the .tex source file in a figure environment instead of the compiled pdf, e.g. \input{source_file.tex}. I think you'll have to fix the orientation etc. in the .tex file though. – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 9:21
@Holene: I did exactly what you said there... Perhaps it's my home computer's fault (I haven't updated my MikTeX for ages). – Herr K. Apr 7 '13 at 9:22

I was able to get it in the proper orientation by using

\includegraphics[angle=90]{diagram.pdf}

But because the bottom half of it is cut off, I need some sort of option where I can do something like this:

\includegraphics[angle=90, shift left = 5cm]{diagram.pdf}

to pull the rest of the image left (or up, depending on how you're looking at it).

So how can I move the figure around?
I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I'm using the following documentclass and packages in my paper:

\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,twoside]{article}
\usepackage{tikz, graphicx}
Edit:

This is not an issue with pushing it past the margins. Half of the picture is not on the paper (sort of like if you stuck half of your left hand behind the left side of your monitor). I need to pull the paper left (just like you would shift your hand left to see it).

have you tried to specify \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth, angle=90]{...}? – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 8:24

width = 1\textwidth will scale the input pdf such that it actually fits the page. I may misunderstand how your problem really looks like, but to me it sounds like you want to push the left side of the pdf past the page margins. In my opinion it's better to stay to the margins. Alternatively you could use the PDFpages package and include the entire PDF? – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 8:34 
@AlanH: Sorry I was wrong about my previous suggestion. But how about this: \hspace{-<some number>in}\includegraphics[angel=90]{...}? Basically this shifts the included picture left by <some number> inch. – Herr K. Apr 7 '13 at 9:03

 \includegraphics makes a box that is positioned the same way \mbox{} or A are positioned. If you want to move it 3cm to the left use

\hspace*{-3cm}\includegraphics.....

@SvendTveskæg because if it is the beginning of a line white glue is discarded so white space and normal \hspace have no effect. – David Carlisle Apr 7 '13 at 9:39

To include shifts directly in the options part of the \includegraphics[options]{graphic.pdf} part of the command, a more straight forward way is the

`trim=left bottom right top` 
option. Here, left, bottom, right, and top are units of length, which trim the graphic for positive values and add space for negative values.

So to move to the right by 5cm and 1 cm from the top, you would do:

\includegraphics[trim=-5cm 0 0 -1cm]{diagram.pdf}

Does the trick, even though I find the parameter name to be misleading (I associate "trimming" with "cropping" instead of "offsetting"). – Waldir Leoncio May 11 '18 at 11:46
This works especially well with figures that have some trailing whitespace preventing any accurate automatic centering! If you trim the whitespace, automatic centering with \includegraphics[width=\linewidth] works again. – bhnn Oct 7 '18 at 17:31

Opting for an answer as the comments with a lot of code have pretty low readability. The ninja pic is taken from http://tinyurl.com/btapmmx

    \node {Node 2: \includegraphics[width=1 in]{images/ninja}};

Hmm, does the xshift option only work when there are two scopes? I was trying with only one scope, and the xshift option wasn't doing anything... – Herr K. Apr 7 '13 at 9:16

@KevinC No, you can simply do: \begin{tikzpicture}[xshift=-5cm] \node{node content}; \end{tikzpicture}. I added the two scopes just to illustrate the difference with and without xshift =) It works fine for me using only one scope too. – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 9:17 
@Holene Okay, I think it's because the picture I'm importing has a slight margin, so I need to pull it past the margin in my article, which is why nothing was shifting for me, it's already pulled to the margin of the article. If I rescale it, which I tried, the picture doesn't look right. – TheRealFakeNews Apr 7 '13 at 9:19
Have you tried adding the .tex source file in a figure environment instead of the compiled pdf, e.g. \input{source_file.tex}. I think you'll have to fix the orientation etc. in the .tex file though. – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 9:21
@Holene: I did exactly what you said there... Perhaps it's my home computer's fault (I haven't updated my MikTeX for ages). – Herr K. Apr 7 '13 at 9:22

How to shift graphics/adjust placement of figure with \includegraphics

I composed a diagram that takes up the entire sheet of paper in landscape mode, called diagram.tex (compiled it to generate pdf). I'm trying to include that into an article, but only half of it is showing; the bottom half is cut off by the right end of the paper.

I was able to get it in the proper orientation by using

\includegraphics[angle=90]{diagram.pdf}

But because the bottom half of it is cut off, I need some sort of option where I can do something like this:

\includegraphics[angle=90, shift left = 5cm]{diagram.pdf}

to pull the rest of the image left (or up, depending on how you're looking at it).

So how can I move the figure around?
I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I'm using the following documentclass and packages in my paper:

\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,twoside]{article}
\usepackage{tikz, graphicx}
Edit:

This is not an issue with pushing it past the margins. Half of the picture is not on the paper (sort of like if you stuck half of your left hand behind the left side of your monitor). I need to pull the paper left (just like you would shift your hand left to see it).

have you tried to specify \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth, angle=90]{...}? – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 8:24 
@Holene I tried it an it shrinks the image, even though all of it is there – TheRealFakeNews Apr 7 '13 at 8:30

width = 1\textwidth will scale the input pdf such that it actually fits the page. I may misunderstand how your problem really looks like, but to me it sounds like you want to push the left side of the pdf past the page margins. In my opinion it's better to stay to the margins. Alternatively you could use the PDFpages package and include the entire PDF? – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 8:34 
@AlanH: Sorry I was wrong about my previous suggestion. But how about this: \hspace{-<some number>in}\includegraphics[angel=90]{...}? Basically this shifts the included picture left by <some number> inch. – Herr K. Apr 7 '13 at 9:03

 \includegraphics makes a box that is positioned the same way \mbox{} or A are positioned. If you want to move it 3cm to the left use

\hspace*{-3cm}\includegraphics.....

@SvendTveskæg because if it is the beginning of a line white glue is discarded so white space and normal \hspace have no effect. – David Carlisle Apr 7 '13 at 9:39

To include shifts directly in the options part of the \includegraphics[options]{graphic.pdf} part of the command, a more straight forward way is the

`trim=left bottom right top` 
option. Here, left, bottom, right, and top are units of length, which trim the graphic for positive values and add space for negative values.

So to move to the right by 5cm and 1 cm from the top, you would do:

\includegraphics[trim=-5cm 0 0 -1cm]{diagram.pdf}

Does the trick, even though I find the parameter name to be misleading (I associate "trimming" with "cropping" instead of "offsetting"). – Waldir Leoncio May 11 '18 at 11:46
This works especially well with figures that have some trailing whitespace preventing any accurate automatic centering! If you trim the whitespace, automatic centering with \includegraphics[width=\linewidth] works again. – bhnn Oct 7 '18 at 17:31

Opting for an answer as the comments with a lot of code have pretty low readability. The ninja pic is taken from http://tinyurl.com/btapmmx

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{scope}
    \node {Node 1: \includegraphics[width=1 in]{images/ninja}};
    \end{scope}
    \begin{scope}[xshift=-5cm]
    \node {Node 2: \includegraphics[width=1 in]{images/ninja}};
    \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\end{document}
Node 2 is now shifted, so if you skip the code for the scopes and node 1, and include your pdf in node 2 you should be able to shift the included pdf here and there.

The result: enter image description here

Hmm, does the xshift option only work when there are two scopes? I was trying with only one scope, and the xshift option wasn't doing anything... – Herr K. Apr 7 '13 at 9:16

@KevinC No, you can simply do: \begin{tikzpicture}[xshift=-5cm] \node{node content}; \end{tikzpicture}. I added the two scopes just to illustrate the difference with and without xshift =) It works fine for me using only one scope too. – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 9:17 
@Holene Okay, I think it's because the picture I'm importing has a slight margin, so I need to pull it past the margin in my article, which is why nothing was shifting for me, it's already pulled to the margin of the article. If I rescale it, which I tried, the picture doesn't look right. – TheRealFakeNews Apr 7 '13 at 9:19
Have you tried adding the .tex source file in a figure environment instead of the compiled pdf, e.g. \input{source_file.tex}. I think you'll have to fix the orientation etc. in the .tex file though. – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 9:21
@Holene: I did exactly what you said there... Perhaps it's my home computer's fault (I haven't updated my MikTeX for ages). – Herr K. Apr 7 '13 at 9:22

    \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\end{document}
Node 2 is now shifted, so if you skip the code for the scopes and node 1, and include your pdf in node 2 you should be able to shift the included pdf here and there.

The result: enter image description here

Hmm, does the xshift option only work when there are two scopes? I was trying with only one scope, and the xshift option wasn't doing anything... – Herr K. Apr 7 '13 at 9:16

@KevinC No, you can simply do: \begin{tikzpicture}[xshift=-5cm] \node{node content}; \end{tikzpicture}. I added the two scopes just to illustrate the difference with and without xshift =) It works fine for me using only one scope too. – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 9:17 
@Holene Okay, I think it's because the picture I'm importing has a slight margin, so I need to pull it past the margin in my article, which is why nothing was shifting for me, it's already pulled to the margin of the article. If I rescale it, which I tried, the picture doesn't look right. – TheRealFakeNews Apr 7 '13 at 9:19
Have you tried adding the .tex source file in a figure environment instead of the compiled pdf, e.g. \input{source_file.tex}. I think you'll have to fix the orientation etc. in the .tex file though. – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 9:21
@Holene: I did exactly what you said there... Perhaps it's my home computer's fault (I haven't updated my MikTeX for ages). – Herr K. Apr 7 '13 at 9:22

How to shift graphics/adjust placement of figure with \includegraphics

I composed a diagram that takes up the entire sheet of paper in landscape mode, called diagram.tex (compiled it to generate pdf). I'm trying to include that into an article, but only half of it is showing; the bottom half is cut off by the right end of the paper.

I was able to get it in the proper orientation by using

\includegraphics[angle=90]{diagram.pdf}

But because the bottom half of it is cut off, I need some sort of option where I can do something like this:

\includegraphics[angle=90, shift left = 5cm]{diagram.pdf}

to pull the rest of the image left (or up, depending on how you're looking at it).

So how can I move the figure around?
I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I'm using the following documentclass and packages in my paper:

\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,twoside]{article}
\usepackage{tikz, graphicx}
Edit:

This is not an issue with pushing it past the margins. Half of the picture is not on the paper (sort of like if you stuck half of your left hand behind the left side of your monitor). I need to pull the paper left (just like you would shift your hand left to see it).

have you tried to specify \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth, angle=90]{...}? – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 8:24 
@Holene I tried it an it shrinks the image, even though all of it is there – TheRealFakeNews Apr 7 '13 at 8:30
@KevinC Could you expand on that? I'm not even sure where in the manual I would be able to find that. – TheRealFakeNews Apr 7 '13 at 8:32

width = 1\textwidth will scale the input pdf such that it actually fits the page. I may misunderstand how your problem really looks like, but to me it sounds like you want to push the left side of the pdf past the page margins. In my opinion it's better to stay to the margins. Alternatively you could use the PDFpages package and include the entire PDF? – Holene Apr 7 '13 at 8:34 
@AlanH: Sorry I was wrong about my previous suggestion. But how about this: \hspace{-<some number>in}\includegraphics[angel=90]{...}? Basically this shifts the included picture left by <some number> inch. – Herr K. Apr 7 '13 at 9:03

 \includegraphics makes a box that is positioned the same way \mbox{} or A are positioned. If you want to move it 3cm to the left use

\hspace*{-3cm}\includegraphics.....

Sorry to interrupt; why use the starred version of \hspace? – Svend Tveskæg Apr 7 '13 at 9:35

@SvendTveskæg because if it is the beginning of a line white glue is discarded so white space and normal \hspace have no effect. – David Carlisle Apr 7 '13 at 9:39

To include shifts directly in the options part of the \includegraphics[options]{graphic.pdf} part of the command, a more straight forward way is the

`trim=left bottom right top` 
option. Here, left, bottom, right, and top are units of length, which trim the graphic for positive values and add space for negative values.

So to move to the right by 5cm and 1 cm from the top, you would do:

\includegraphics[trim=-5cm 0 0 -1cm]{diagram.pdf}

It is better so post complete working examples instead fragments of code – user31729 Jul 15 '14 at 12:54
This worked for me. – polym May 13 '15 at 23:28
Does the trick, even though I find the parameter name to be misleading (I associate "trimming" with "cropping" instead of "offsetting"). – Waldir Leoncio May 11 '18 at 11:46
This works especially well with figures that have some trailing whitespace preventing any accurate automatic centering! If you trim the whitespace, automatic centering with \includegraphics[width=\linewidth] works again. – bhnn Oct 7 '18 at 17:31

Opting for an answer as the comments with a lot of code have pretty low readability. The ninja pic is taken from http://tinyurl.com/btapmmx

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{scope}
    \node {Node 1: \includegraphics[width=1 in]{images/ninja}};
    \end{scope}
    \begin{scope}[xshift=-5cm]
    \node {Node 2: \includegraphics[width=1 in]{images/ninja}};
    \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\end{document}
Node 2 is now shifted, so if you skip the code for the scopes and node 1, and include your pdf in node 2 you should be able to shift the included pdf here and there.
